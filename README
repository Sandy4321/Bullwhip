Bullwhip is a simple 2D game engine.
It is coded in C++, uses SFML for rendering, Box2D for physics, and Lua for scripting

Quick note on the branches:
Lamborghini is the most stable build and is the release build. ('Gold' or 'release' build)
Ferrari is the semi-working build. It is updated more often than Lamborghini, but it might have some bugs. ('Silver' build)
Corvette is the working build. You should almost never use this branch, it has the most bugs and might not even compile.
